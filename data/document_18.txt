Early life[edit]
Haston was born in London, England and graduated in 1980 with a master's degree in English Literature from Emmanuel College, Cambridge University.

Career[edit]
A career in finance has been augmented in recent years by writing. Haston published his debut novel Blood and Doves in October 2012, followed almost contemporaneously by Rising of a Dead Moon (first published October 2012, re-written and published in final form October 2013), and Echo and the Magical Whispers (September 2013). Haston has a spartan writing style that often requires the reader to provide linkages within the story line and characterisation[4] Themes of class and the suffering of the under-privileged are pursued. Rising of a Dead Moon examines the plight of Indian widows in a historical context: the 19th century diaspora of 'coolies' from India to work on the white-owned sugar plantations in South Africa. Blood and Doves is a comment on Victorian class morality as seen through the eyes of a working class anti-hero.

Haston is an advocate for elephants and a member of several elephant charities. Echo and the Magical Whispers was written to raise awareness of poaching of elephants for their ivory. The book won a silver medal at the 2015 Moonbeam Children's Book Awards.[5]
